### Web app for creating tile-based sprites ✏️

## Goals

* This project follows my [Wheel Reinventor's Principles](https://github.com/tobloef/wheel-reinventors-principles): In short, it's made from scratch for learning and to tailor it to my specific use cases.


> [!WARNING]
> This project was created primarily for personal use. I would not recommend using it in any of your own applications (but let me know if you do!).
